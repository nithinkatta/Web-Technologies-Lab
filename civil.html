    <h1>Civil Engineering</h1>
    Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that involves designing, building, and maintaining the physical environment. It includes public works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, and buildings. Civil engineers also work on infrastructure for a cleaner environment, such as drinking water and energy systems, sea ports, and irrigation projects. 
Civil engineers apply planning, designing, construction, maintenance, and operating infrastructure while protecting the public and environmental health. They also improve existing infrastructure that may have been neglected. 
Civil engineering includes many branches, such as:
Material science and engineering
Studies the basic properties of materials, such as concrete, asphalt concrete, aluminum, steel, and polymers
Surveying
An engineering operation that involves assessing and recording details about an area of land
